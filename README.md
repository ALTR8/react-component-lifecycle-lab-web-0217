# React Component Lifecycle Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice rendering React components, making use of the different parts of
   the component lifecycle
2. Build a small React application

## Overview

This lab is meant to give students a chance to practice pulling together
_everything_ that they've learned in this unit.

We can have them build a small but fairly complex (though not complicated)
application. It'd be great to have them fetch some remote data, selectively
update state, etc.
